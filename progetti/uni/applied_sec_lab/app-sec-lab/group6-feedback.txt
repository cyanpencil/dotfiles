======================================================================

General:
- progress is good, but be more precise where possible, missing backup
- be mindful of space - you already use 27 of 30 pages; but 4 of the pages are blank, please fix!
- group some risk analysis parts together to save space


System Characterization/Overview:
- according to Fig 1 the admin server is in the DMZ with the webserver - intended? webserver in DMZ is expected; please clarify what the different connections mean, and why, via the mgmt network, it looks like the backup is reachable from the internet
- your text contradicts itself (and fig 1), where it only allows access to webserver from outside through firewall, and later allows access to admin server; make this consistent
- font size too small in Fig.1
- where are the private keys stored? 

Components:
- you should also describe the interfaces between components and other types of components, what does "internal API" mean and how is it secured?
- why does the webserver need a list of public keys? the keys associated with valid certificates from imovies CA should do, right? a CRL may be needed for revoked certs of course
- backup: how is this done? cron job? push or pull? append only, but admin has full access - clarify
- core CA: does it do any validation on requests from webserver?
- missing session management


Security Design
- use the security principles in the functionality/component description to explain what and why you are doing things - presenting the principles separately makes it hard to connect them to the system
- how is data protected in transit, and what authentication is used between systems?
- how is data protected at rest, and what data is kept where?
- you do not talk about authenticity at all

Assets:
+ missing: some assets' security properties (only availability described mostly)
+ do not describe the functionality offered by certain assets here, this belongs in section 1
+ missing information assets: CRL, CA private keys
+ logical assets
  + risk evaluation is quite imprecise: please do distinguish different logical assets as they do not all have the same security properties, locations (e.g., DMZ vs intranet) - just 'software' and 'information' is not enough
+ Logical: Information: which keys?
+ what about intangible goods?

Threat sources:
+ malware?

Risk Analysis:
+ please number threats consecutively across subsections: 1, 2, 3, ... (commenting on them is otherwise tedious)
+ 3: this extra backup stored outside should be described in section 1 already
+ 4: you would still lose network connectivity
+242-6: risk acceptance is usually for high risk items only, just change wording
+ you are duplicating a lot of text here for each physical machine where many threats are identical, relating to data center compromise/destruction/etc; collect this kind of problem into a section for ALL machines at once, to reduce duplication
+pages 15,19,22,25 break the allowed format, and use expected whitespace at the bottom, overwriting page number
+ 243-8 countermeasure: ssh keys can be disclosed as well
+ why do you interleave people/person sections with physical assets, reconsider structure
+ risk acceptance section missing at the end, should only be done for all high (possibly medium) risk results
+ logical asset "information", 2.4.10, is very short, especially compared to physical assets
+ risk evaluation of software is missing
+ natural catastrophes on logical asset?
+ illness or death on logical asset?
