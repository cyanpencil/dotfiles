Implementation with queues does not improve latency significantly - show graphs

What changes a lot is the burst response:

no queues -> 99% packet loss at size 100

queues -> 45% packet loss at size 200, almmost some dropped packets
           5% packet loss at size 100, almmost no dropped packets
