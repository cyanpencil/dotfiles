2018 &  \textbf{Raymarching distance fields:} rendered a procedurally generated volcanic archipelagus \\
     & entirely made in the fragment shader in GLSL for the final project of the Computer \\
     %& Graphics course. \href{https://drive.google.com/open?id=1U4zynGm8o4i8VodnaWTOjgoayj9rhega}{Short pdf description.} \\
     & Graphics course.  \\
2016 &  \textbf{Voronoi stippling}: I wrote a program in Python to emulate the stippling painting \\
     & technique using weighted voronois. I was supervised by my Programming Fundamentals \\
     & professor, but it was an extracurricular activity. \\
2015 &  \textbf{Italian Olympiads in Mathematics}: I got the bronze medal in the national finals. \\
     & It was an high school individual competition, which revolved around solving both \\
     & numerical and demonstration problems. \\
2014 &  \textbf{Musical Floppies}: developed for my high school thesis, I connected 8 old floppy \\
     & drives with an Arduino, and by moving their stepper motors at precise frequences \\
     & I was able to play simple tunes with the noise they produced.\\
2014 &  \textbf{Italian Olympiads in Informatics}: I got the 12th place in the national finals \\
     & and got a silver medal. It was an high school competition that revolved around \\
     & the solution and C++ implementation of algorithmical problems. I was also \\
     & selected for the IOI training camps. \\

\section{Project / Competition Experience (Team)}
\begin{tabular}{rl}
2018 &  \textbf{Google Hashcode:} partecipated in the Google Hashcode (March 2018) in a team of 4,\\
     & an international programming competition revolving around optimisation problems. We got \\
     & the first place in Italy (out of 300 Italian teams), 85th place in the world (out of 5000 teams). \\
2017 &  \textbf{SWERC 2017}: I partecipated as a member of the "Sapienza Red" team, held in Paris\\
     & in November 2017.\\
2016 &  \textbf{SWERC 2016}: I partecipated as a member of the "Sapienza" team, held in Porto\\
     & in November 2016.\\
2015 &  \textbf{Exhibitor at Codemotion Rome}: I was the main coder of "Pico", a Google Cardboard \\
     & flight simulator for Android in which the player controlled the wings of the plane \\
     & by holding two Wii controllers (connected via bluetooth to the Android phone) in \\
     & his hands and tilting them accordignly. The game got featured and exhibited at \\
     & Codemotion Rome 2015.\\
2015 &  \textbf{Global Game Jam Rome}: I won first prize in the "Graphics" category and second prize \\
     & for "Gameplay" category. Partecipated together with my sister. Our game, "Poopfest",\\
     & featured handmade watercoulour drawings.\\
2013-2015 & \textbf{Italian Olympiads in Mathematics}: I partecipated three times in the national finals\\
     & of the team competition of the Italian Olympiads. We got two medals: a bronze medal \\
     & in 2013 (for the 3rd place), and a silver medal in 2015 (for the 2nd place). In 2013\\
     & and 2014, I was only a member of the team, while in 2015 I was the captain.\\
2013-2015 & \textbf{Ludum Dare Game Jam}: I partecipated five times in this team competition in which you have\\
     & to code a game in 72 hours. In all of those five times I partecipated with my sister;\\
     & I was the main coder, while she was both the artist and the secondary coder. We got \\
     & occasional help from friends for the music. All of our games where made in Java, using \\
     & the Processing library. One of our games got the first place in the "Most Funny" \\
     & category, and 6th place in the "Overall" category (the number of games sent every \\
     & competition floats around a thousand).\\
2013 & \textbf{Cleanweb Hackaton}: I won the first prize by developing a prototype of an application\\
     & to help people visualize if they reduced their electricity consumption in their houses.\\

\section{Hobbies and Interests}
During my spare time I enjoy playing chess, listening to music (in particular when programming), and going out with friends.
I am not a bookworm, but if I stumble upon a book I like, I can't go to sleep unless I've finished it.
