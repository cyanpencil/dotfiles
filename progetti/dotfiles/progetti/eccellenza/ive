     ssccpp copies files between hosts on a network.  It uses ssh(1) for data transfer, and uses the same authen‐
     tication and provides the same security as ssh(1).  ssccpp will ask for passwords or passphrases if they are
     needed for authentication.

     File names may contain a user and host specification to indicate that the file is to be copied to/from
     that host.  Local file names can be made explicit using absolute or relative pathnames to avoid ssccpp
     treating file names containing ‘:’ as host specifiers.  Copies between two remote hosts are also permit‐
     ted.

     The options are as follows:

     --11      Forces ssccpp to use protocol 1.

     --22      Forces ssccpp to use protocol 2.

     --33      Copies between two remote hosts are transferred through the local host.  Without this option the
             data is copied directly between the two remote hosts.  Note that this option disables the
             progress meter.

     --44      Forces ssccpp to use IPv4 addresses only.

     --66      Forces ssccpp to use IPv6 addresses only.

     --BB      Selects batch mode (prevents asking for passwords or passphrases).

     --CC      Compression enable.  Passes the --CC flag to ssh(1) to enable compression.

     --cc _c_i_p_h_e_r
             Selects the cipher to use for encrypting the data transfer.  This option is directly passed to
             ssh(1).

     --FF _s_s_h___c_o_n_f_i_g
             Specifies an alternative per-user configuration file for sssshh.  This option is directly passed to
             ssh(1).

     --ii _i_d_e_n_t_i_t_y___f_i_l_e
             Selects the file from which the identity (private key) for public key authentication is read.
             This option is directly passed to ssh(1).

     --ll _l_i_m_i_t
             Limits the used bandwidth, specified in Kbit/s.

     --oo _s_s_h___o_p_t_i_o_n
             Can be used to pass options to sssshh in the format used in ssh_config(5).  This is useful for spec‐
             ifying options for which there is no separate ssccpp command-line flag.  For full details of the
             options listed below, and their possible values, see ssh_config(5).

     --PP _p_o_r_t
             Specifies the port to connect to on the remote host.  Note that this option is written with a
             capital ‘P’, because --pp is already reserved for preserving the times and modes of the file.

     --pp      Preserves modification times, access times, and modes from the original file.

     --qq      Quiet mode: disables the progress meter as well as warning and diagnostic messages from ssh(1).

     --rr      Recursively copy entire directories.  Note that ssccpp follows symbolic links encountered in the
             tree traversal.

     --SS _p_r_o_g_r_a_m
             Name of _p_r_o_g_r_a_m to use for the encrypted connection.  The program must understand ssh(1) options.

     --vv      Verbose mode.  Causes ssccpp and ssh(1) to print debugging messages about their progress.  This is
             helpful in debugging connection, authentication, and configuration problems.

     ssccpp is based on the rcp program in BSD source code from the Regents of the University of California.
