you can't access other people capabilities because they are not in your cspace; you don't have a pointer to them.

The capabilities are stored on a two-level space that is mainly useful for space reasoning and sparsity.

The dispatcher of a process has a lot of "registers"; between them, there is one that is the root of the cspace 
	(this means, every process has a different root space)

The difference between revoke and delete:
	delete erases only a copy of a capability;
	revoke erases all copies of a capability. (but revoke is not implemented?)
	revoke erases all of its descendants too!


There is no dynamic memory allocation in the kernel _at all_.

You can only retype capabilities from the last used offset ... ?
